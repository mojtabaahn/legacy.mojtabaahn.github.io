So, I finally managed to get my shit together and start writing.

Starting a blog is not some new plan in my head, it's like more than 5 years I'm passionate about it but never had enough confidence to start one.

There are many good reasons for starting this blog that I would write about in future.

For now, I will try to write about some tech stacks I have experience working with and also some Open-Source projects I've worked on. for later on I might expand this blog to other fields like photography and games..

Anyways, *Thank You* You for reading this. I try my best to make this a good place to spend time on!
