So recently I was thinking about how Laravel validates forms so eloquently and how to implement same behaviour in python, more specifically with Pydantic models without breaking any existing validation standards of Pydantic.

I know there is a logical discussion that in Pydantic we are using a complete different approach in it can be an anti-pattern to implement such thing. but for a real laravel fan everything can be Laravelized.
